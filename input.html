<h1>Input</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have an Input Strength?</h2>
<h3>
You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information -- 
words, facts, books, and quotations -- or you might collect tangible objects 
such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs.
<br>
<br>
Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. And yours is the 
kind of mind that finds so many things interesting. The world is exciting 
precisely because of its infinite variety and complexity.
<br>
<br>
If you read a great deal, it is not necessarily to refine your theories but, rather, 
to add more information to your archives. If you like to travel, it is because each
 new location offers novel artifacts and facts. These can be acquired and then 
 stored away. Why are they worth storing? At the time of storing, it is often hard 
 to say exactly when or why you might need them, but who knows when they 
 might become useful?
<br>
<br>
With all those possible uses in mind, you really don't feel comfortable throwing 
anything away. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It's 
interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove 
valuable.</h3>
