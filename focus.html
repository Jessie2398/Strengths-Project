<h1>Focus</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have a Focus Strength?</h2>
<br>
<h3>"Where am I headed?" you ask yourself. You ask this question every day. 
    Guided by this theme of Focus, you need a clear destination. Lacking one, 
    your life and your work can quickly become frustrating. And so each year, 
    each month, and even each week, you set goals. These goals then serve as 
    your compass, helping you determine priorities and make the necessary 
    corrections to get back on course.<br>
<br>
    Your Focus is powerful because it forces you to filter; you instinctively 
    evaluate whether or not a particular action will help you move toward your 
    goal. Those that don't are ignored. In the end, then, your Focus forces you to
     be efficient. Naturally, the flip side of this is that it causes you to become 
     impatient with delays, obstacles, and even tangents, no matter how intriguing 
     they appear to be. This makes you an extremely valuable team member.<br>
    <br>
    When others start to wander down other avenues, you bring them back to the 
    main road. Your Focus reminds everyone that if something is not helping you
     move toward your destination, then it is not important. And if it is not 
     important, then it is not worth your time. You keep everyone on point.</h3>
