<h1>Achievers</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have an Achiever Strength?</h2>
<h3>Your Achiever theme helps explain your drive. Achiever describes a constant
     need for attainment. You feel as if each day starts at zero. By the day's end, 
     you must achieve something tangible to feel good about yourself. And by 
     "every day," you mean every single day -- workdays, weekends, and vacations.<br>
     <br>
    No matter how much you may feel you deserve a day of rest, if the day passes 
    without some form of achievement, no matter how small, you will feel 
    dissatisfied. You have an internal fire burning inside you. It pushes you to do 
    more, to achieve more.<br>
    <br>
        After each accomplishment is reached, the fire dwindles for a moment,
         but very soon, it rekindles itself, forcing you toward the next accomplishment. 
         Your relentless need for achievement might not be logical. It might not even
          be focused. But it will always be with you.<br>
          <br>
        As an Achiever, you must learn to live with this whisper of discontent. It 
        does have its benefits. It brings you the energy you need to work long hours 
        without burning out. It is the jolt you can always count on to get you started 
        on new tasks and challenges. It is the power supply that causes you to set the
         pace and define the levels of productivity for your workgroup. It is the theme
          that keeps you moving.</h3>
