<h2 id="Question1">1. Which parts of the report really describe me?</h2>
   
<p>All of them are so much like you, it's actually kind of disconcerting lol
      With learning, You learn simply for the joy of learning. You can't not learn. 
      You go stir crazy if you don't learn something. Input you love to get because youre like a vacuum. 
      You grab all the information you can about a subject and then you move on to analyze it. 
      All 5 themes run into each other because in most things you do, your actions and thoughts pass
       through one theme to another until you have gone through all of them.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="Question 2">2. What surprises you?</h2>

   <p>Actually, nothing. I've seen all of them you very prevalently. It's rather astounding lol</p>
<br>

<h2 id="Question 3"> 3. Which of the 5 themes have you noticed in me the most?</h2>

   <p>Analyzing is a huge one I have noticed. You Analyze literally everything, 
   even if it doesn't need to be or can't be analyzed (no offense lol). 
   Your drive to Analyze things is very intense. You respect privacy, but at the same time, 
   your analyzing kicks into over drive with anything someone says or does. 
   With each message or action, you step back and analyze it to the very minutest thing, trying to find out why, 
   when, where, how. Mostly the "why" question though. Your brain is like a computer and coding. 
   Everything has to be just so and you have to know each thing to be able to put everything in its correct spot. 
   If you come up with no solid analysis, it drives you crazy because "there has to be a good explanation."</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Question4">4. Can you give me an example of when and how you've seen this theme or these themes in me?</h2>

<p>Well, it happens on a daily basis with literally everything. But a lot of it is very noticeable when 
   dealing with Discord things or different dramas that happen. Each time something occurs, you talk with 
   people to find out their side (Learner), then you collect that information (Input) and then you sort it out 
   (Analyze). If things correspond between different peoples stories, then you feel relieved and can move onto 
   the next thing (Achiever). 
   <br>
   <br>
   Often when trying to settle disputes, you lay out all the information and you analyze it to death lol. 
   And sometimes some it can be broken down into more information... and sometimes it doesn't and it really 
   frustrates you when I say, "That's not how it is. They aren't like that. You're reading too much in between the 
   lines and starting to assume." That's what really drives you crazy because then you tell me "There has to be a 
   reason and nothing else makes sense so it must be this. I'm not getting the same information as you, so they 
   must not like me or they must have a problem with me. They said this or they didn't respond, so they must not 
   like me." 
   <br>
   <br>
   That's when #5 Focus comes in. Towards the end of the dramas, you start questioning everything. 
   Who you are and what you are doing. What people think of you and when you aren't coming up with answers, 
   it frustrates you. You get frustrated and overthink when someone talks to long to respond and then sometimes 
   feel like if your time doesn't matter to the person, they their time doesn't matter to you. While sometimes this 
   is good, other times it can be rather painful for you and the other person. But on the other side, when you do 
   this with information, you can sort out the non-important things and just focus on the important parts, thus 
   getting things done quicker and more efficiently. If someone starts to go off on something that isn't deemed 
   important, then you quickly are like "Hey now, forget that and focus on the important part. You're going off on 
   a rabbit trail so let's get back on track." You knock out the piddly stuff and tell everyone what really needs to 
   be worked on. And part of the time, like with the Hanna situation, you're the only one that can say that kind of 
   stuff to get the sense back into people. ðŸ¤£ Like I said, it's an assembly line. You go through every single theme 
   to get to the conclusion of something.</p>
