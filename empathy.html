<h1>Empathy</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have an Empathy Strength?</h2>
<h3>You can sense the emotions of those around you. You can feel what they are feeling as though their 
    feelings are your own. Intuitively, you are able to see the world through their eyes and share their perspective.
<br>
<br>
    You do not necessarily agree with each person's perspective. You do not necessarily feel pity for each person's 
    predicament -- this would be sympathy, not empathy.
    <br>
    <br>
    You do not necessarily condone the choices each person makes, but you do understand. This instinctive ability to understand is powerful.
    <br>
    <br>
    You hear the unvoiced questions. You anticipate the need. Where others grapple for words, you seem to find the right 
    words and the right tone. You help people find the right phrases to express their feelings -- to themselves as well as to
     others. You help them give voice to their emotional life. For all these reasons, other people are drawn to you.</h3>
