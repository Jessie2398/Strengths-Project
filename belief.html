<h1>Belief</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have a Belief Strength?</h2>
<h3>If you possess a strong Belief theme, you have certain core values that are enduring. These values vary 
    from one person to another, but ordinarily your Belief theme causes you to be family-oriented, altruistic, even 
    spiritual, and to value responsibility and high ethics -- both in yourself and others.
<br>
<br>
    These core values affect your behavior in many ways. They give your life meaning and satisfaction; in your view, 
    success is more than money and prestige. They provide you with direction, guiding you through the temptations 
    and distractions of life toward a consistent set of priorities.
    <br>
    <br>
    This consistency is the foundation for all your relationships. Your friends call you dependable. "I know where you 
    stand," they say. Your Belief makes you easy to trust. It also demands that you find work that meshes with your values. 
    Your work must be meaningful; it must matter to you. And guided by your Belief theme, it will matter only if it gives you 
    a chance to live out your values.</h3>
