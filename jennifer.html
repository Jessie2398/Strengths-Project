<h2 id="Question1">1. Which parts of the report really describe me?</h2>
   
<p id="one">You are deliberate, as I tend to love running headlong into minefields and burning bridges, you definitely reign me in.
    Just yesterday or something I mentioned that you voiced something about me that I couldn't voice myself, and I pointed 
    it out to you. Reading the Empathy trait, that is what you did...and always do! 
    Oh man, you sometimes are too responsible. You take on situations like the Hanna one and are determined to see it through 
    to completion...even if it costs you your sanity and stresses you out. It's also a really great trait because I can trust you with 
    situations and data I wouldn't anyone else...a lot of people feel this way because you take ownership of your actions.
    Responsible trait runs parallel with Belief, and it is nearly impossible to separate the two as they go hand in hand. You are 
    adamant about what data you share about other people, stemming from a deep-set belief system. I see your beliefs pop up 
    all the time and it is a very trustworthy part of you. (ie, your Nick went against some of your belief systems and you showed him the door) 
    That example runs with deliberate, as you don't open up with people who don't share your beliefs. Only fairly recently you have become 
    friends with hackerman.
    Developer, now that right there with empathy might be the trademark of your personality. You see stuff no one really sees in themselves 
    and jerk it out of them with your empathy trait.  For example, you saw the potential of me working with Hackerman as a mod, when I 
    would rather eat a lemon. You deliberately pulled out with empathy backed with your beliefs with the trust you built up with responsibility 
    that there was something of a gem you could develop in that situation out of me, and set out to do it.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="Question2">2. What surprises you?</h2>

   <p id="two">I thought you had a learning trait. >.< </p>
<br>

<h2 id="Question3"> 3. Which of the 5 themes have you noticed in me the most?</h2>

   <p i="three">Now I understand what this feels like. XD You like sucker punch us all with a combination of all of these blended together in a 
    medley. If I had to choose one, I would say deliberate because you see life in the scope of trying to save people like a superhero. You see 
    land mines and are like DON'T STEP THERE, which lands you into so many people's lives as you are driven to keep them safe from 
    themselves. I think one of your first steps from an observer's point of view to moving in to save the day is this deliberate trait...nothing is 
    by chance here.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Question4">4. Can you give me an example of when and how you've seen this theme or these themes in me?</h2>

<p>Developers respond to development, even if you don't see the jewels in yourself, you trust the closest people to you to see them and
     show it to you. For instance, you are surrounded by coders and someone decided to encourage you to code cause they saw a jewel for it in 
     you. Now you code a lot more than them.</p>
