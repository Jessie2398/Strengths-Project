<h1>Responsibility</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have a Responsibility Strength?</h2>
<h3>Your Responsibility theme forces you to take psychological ownership for anything you commit to, 
    and whether large or small, you feel emotionally bound to follow it through to completion. Your good name depends on it.
<br>
<br>
    If for some reason you cannot deliver, you automatically start to look for ways to make it up to the other person. 
    Apologies are not enough. Excuses and rationalizations are totally unacceptable. You will not quite be able to live with 
    yourself until you have made restitution.
    <br>
    <br>
    This conscientiousness, this near obsession for doing things right, and your impeccable ethics combine to create your 
    reputation: utterly dependable. When assigning new responsibilities, people will look to you first because they know it will get done.
    <br>
    <br>
    When people come to you for help -- and they soon will -- you must be selective. Your willingness to volunteer may sometimes 
    lead you to take on more than you should.</h3>
