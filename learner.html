<h1>Learners</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have a Learner Strength?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be 
    determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, 
    you will always be drawn to the process of learning. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you.
     You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to 
     competence. The thrill of the first few facts, the early efforts to recite or 
     practice what you have learned, the growing confidence of a skill mastered, 
     this is the process that entices you. 
     <br>
     <br>
    Your excitement leads you to engage in adult learning experiences, yoga or 
    piano lessons or graduate classes. It enables you to thrive in dynamic work 
    environments where you are asked to take on short project assignments and 
    are expected to learn a lot about the new subject matter in a short period of 
    time and then move on to the next one. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the 
    subject-matter expert or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies 
    a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less 
    significant than the "getting there."
