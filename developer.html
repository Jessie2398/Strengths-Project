<h1>Developer</h1>
<h2>What does it mean to have a Developer Strength?</h2>
<h3>You see the potential in others. Very often, in fact, potential is all you see. In your view, no individual is fully formed. 
    On the contrary, each individual is a work in progress, alive with possibilities. And you are drawn toward people for this very reason.
<br>
<br>
    When you interact with others, your goal is to help them experience success. You look for ways to challenge them. You devise 
    interesting experiences that can stretch them and help them grow. And all the while you are on the lookout for the signs of growth
     -- a new behavior learned or modified, a slight improvement in a skill, a glimpse of excellence or of "flow" where previously there 
     were only halting steps.
    <br>
    <br>
    For you these small increments -- invisible to some -- are clear signs of potential being realized. These signs of growth in others 
    are your fuel. They bring you strength and satisfaction. Over time many will seek you out for help and encouragement because, 
    on some level, they know that your helpfulness is both genuine and fulfilling to you.</h3>
