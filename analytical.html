<h1>Analytical</h1>

<h2>What does it mean to have an Analytical Strength?</h2>

<h3>Your Analytical theme challenges other people: "Prove it. Show me why 
    what you are claiming is true." In the face of this kind of questioning, some 
    will find that their brilliant theories wither and die. For you, this is precisely 
    the point. <br>
    <br>
You do not necessarily want to destroy other people's ideas, but you do insist 
that their theories be sound. You see yourself as objective and dispassionate.
You like data because they are value free. They have no agenda. Armed with 
these data, you search for patterns and connections.<br>
<br>
You want to understand how certain patterns affect one another. How do they 
combine? What is their outcome? Does this outcome fit with the theory being 
offered or the situation being confronted? These are your questions.<br>
<br>
You peel the layers back until, gradually, the root cause or causes are revealed. 
Others see you as logical and rigorous. Over time they will come to you in order
 to expose someone's "wishful thinking" or "clumsy thinking" to your refining 
 mind.<br>
<br>
It is hoped that your analysis is never delivered too harshly. Otherwise, others 
may avoid you when that "wishful thinking" is their own..</h3>
